#summary The various milestones in development of this tool.

= Introduction =

This tool will be developed incrementally, with more complex features implemented lastly.

= Milestones =

 *  Flash detection research (+ associated optimization).
 *  Building skeleton of Chrome plugin -- ability to stream screen captures into a JavaScript accessible array of images.
 *  Begin initial flash detection algorithm implementation (luminosity and then red flash) with HTML5's canvas + pixel manipulation.
 *  Research flash mitigation algorithms.
 *  Incorporate black frame blocking out offending content on the fly.
 *  Incorporate opaque frame partially blocking offending content on the fly to only block to the level that renders the content safe to the user.
 *  Add features to adjust sensitivity of tool.
 *  Further optimizations and bug fixes.
